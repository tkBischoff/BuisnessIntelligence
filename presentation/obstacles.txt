OBSTACLES THAT WE ENCOUNTERED

1. Imcompleteness:
	- Rule 34: If it exists, there is porn about it
		--> almost infinitely many categories, special keywords, sometimes secret "codewords"
			--> impossible to get all the queries that were meant to look for porn

2. Underinclusion:
	- typos like „pancreatits“ instead of „pancreatitis“ made it hard to really filter for only the right keywords
	- many ambiguous queries (looking for porn or looking for information on sexual topics, help in case of abuse (because porn queries can be very aggressive and brutal), etc.)
		--> false hits included, even if we minimised these:
		for example, we kicked out all illegal categories, because those were very often very ambiguous and especially for such a sensitive topic we wouldn't have wanted to present highly distorted results

3. Data Issues:
	- values for weekdays had many spaces in it after exporting the result tables, took us long to notice why nothing worked when 		mapping the weekday names

4. Outliers:
	- we had a few outliers for the "day of the year" plot, one of them an extreme outlier, but for that one we didn't find any 		information that would tell us why we have such an extreme outlier for that date
